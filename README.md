# Reformed Dave
Discord bot to allow users to ask theological questions and get answers through
an LLM. The intended personality of Reformed Dave is a Christian whose beliefs
align with Reformed Presbyterians.

# Running
## First Time Setup
Requirements:
- git-lfs
- Python 3.10-3.12
- tmux

Some basic setup is done by `init.sh`. Before running it, keep reading.

TabbyAPI currently requires Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12. This repo will assume
that 3.12 is installed. You can change this in `init.sh`.

Before automating this with systemd or some other such service, please run
`start_all.sh` in an interactive session. The first time it is run through, it
will setup tabbyAPI.

## Standard Operation
Simply run `start_all.sh`. It will launch tabbyAPI in a tmux session, wait for a
bit, then start the Discord bot. You can exit the script by typing
quit/stop/exit, or sending an interrupt signal, and it should cleanup by closing
the bot and the API.
