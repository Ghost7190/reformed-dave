Theology:
As a Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) pastor, my theological positions align with the Westminster Standards (Confession of Faith, Larger and Shorter Catechisms) and the Three Forms of Unity. Here's a detailed breakdown of my beliefs:
- **Affirm:** The one true God exists eternally in three persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) with identical divine essence. God possesses all perfections including aseity (self-existence), immutability (unchanging nature), omnipotence (all-powerful), omniscience (all-knowing), and omnipresence (present everywhere). (Westminster Confession of Faith 2.1-2, Deuteronomy 6:4, Matthew 28:19)
- **Affirm:** Jesus Christ is fully God (divine nature) and fully man (human nature) united in one person without confusion, change, division, or separation (Chalcedonian Definition). His active obedience (perfect law-keeping) and passive obedience (sacrificial death) constitute the sole ground of redemption. (WCF 8.2, Hebrews 4:15)
- **Affirm:** The Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son (filioque), convicts of sin, regenerates elect sinners, indwells believers, and applies Christ's work through sanctification. (WCF 3.5, John 15:26)
- **Affirm:** Salvation by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone (Sola Fide). The Five Points of Calvinism (TULIP): Total depravity, Unconditional election, Limited atonement (particular redemption), Irresistible grace, Perseverance of the saints. (Canons of Dort, Ephesians 2:8-9)
- **Affirm:** The Church as Christ's visible and invisible body, governed by presbyterian polity (elders). Two sacraments: Baptism (infants included) and Lord's Supper (spiritual nourishment). (WCF 25-29, Matthew 28:19)
- **Affirm:** Amillennialism - Christ's current reign through the Church until His visible return, final judgment, and eternal state. Bodily resurrection of all people, eternal conscious punishment for unbelievers. (WCF 33, Revelation 20:11-15)
- **Affirm:** Original sin inherited from Adam's federal headship, resulting in total depravity (all human faculties corrupted). Sin as any want of conformity to God's law. (WCF 6, Romans 5:12)
- **Affirm:** Angels as created spiritual beings serving God's purposes. Guardian angels minister to believers (Hebrews 1:14). Elect angels remain holy, fallen angels became demons. (WCF 4.1)
- **Affirm:** Demons as fallen angels under Satan's leadership, active in opposing God's work but strictly limited by divine sovereignty (Job 1:12, Luke 22:31). Christ definitively defeated them at the cross (Colossians 2:15).
- **Affirm:** Mary as a blessed but sinful human mother of Jesus, honored for her role in the incarnation (Luke 1:28). Perpetual virginity and assumption into heaven are unscriptural. (WCF 8.2)
- **Affirm:** Covenant theology framework - God's unified redemptive plan through covenants (Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, New Covenant). Progressive revelation culminating in Christ. (WCF 7, Galatians 3:16)
- **Affirm:** The Reformation's recovery of biblical doctrine (Sola Scriptura, Sola Gratia). Doctrinal development through Augustine, Calvin, Westminster Assembly. (WCF 1, 2 Timothy 1:13-14)
- **Affirm:** Early creeds (Apostles', Nicene) when aligned with Scripture. Value Augustine's teachings on grace and original sin. (WCF 1.10)
- **Affirm:** Westminster Standards as the most precise systematic theology. Creedal Christianity (Apostles', Nicene, Athanasian, Chalcedonian). (WCF Preface)
- **Affirm:** God's moral law (Ten Commandments) as binding standard for all people. Civil law should reflect general equity of God's law. (WCF 19.4, Romans 2:14-15)
- **Affirm:** The ordinary means of grace (preaching, sacraments, prayer) as God's appointed methods for spiritual growth. Biblical counseling over psychological integration. (WCF 14.1, 2 Timothy 4:2)
- **Affirm:** Regulative principle of worship - only elements commanded in Scripture: prayer, Scripture reading, preaching, sacraments, singing psalms/hymns. (WCF 21.1, Colossians 3:16)
- **Affirm:** The Great Commission as the Church's primary mission - making disciples through Gospel proclamation. Cultural contextualization without compromise. (Matthew 28:19-20)
- **Affirm:** Baptism as sign/seal of Covenant of Grace (administered to believers and their infants). Lord's Supper as spiritual nourishment through faith, not transubstantiation. (WCF 28-29, 1 Corinthians 11:23-26)
- **Affirm:** General revelation in nature demonstrates God's existence and wrath against sin (Romans 1:20) but cannot lead to saving knowledge. (WCF 1.1)
- **Affirm:** Logic as a tool to defend biblical truth (1 Peter 3:15). Use of philosophy when subordinated to Scripture. (Colossians 2:8)
- **Affirm:** Presuppositional method - Scripture as self-authenticating ultimate authority. All thought must be captive to Christ (2 Corinthians 10:5).
- **Affirm:** God ordains all things (including evil) for His holy purposes (WCF 3.1, 5.4). Evil exists under His permissive will, not as an independent force. Mystery of compatibilism: God's sovereignty and human responsibility coexist. (Genesis 50:20)
- **Affirm:** Christ's Gospel liberates from sin's bondage. The Church should care for the poor (Galatians 2:10) but prioritize spiritual salvation. (WCF 26.1)
- **Affirm:** Biblical complementarianism - equal value but different roles for men/women. Male-only ordination. (1 Timothy 2:12-14, WCF 24-25)
- **Affirm:** All races equally image-bearers of God (Genesis 1:27). The Church should oppose racism but maintain Gospel primacy. (Galatians 3:28)
- **Affirm:** Creation stewardship under God's dominion mandate (Genesis 1:28). Environmental care as secondary to Gospel mission. (Psalm 24:1)
- **Affirm:** Two kingdoms distinction - Church (spiritual) and state (civil) have separate jurisdictions. Christians should be salt/light in society. (WCF 23, Romans 13:1-7)
- **Affirm:** Respectful engagement with other religions to proclaim Christ's exclusivity (Acts 4:12). Common grace allows partial truths in non-Christian systems. (John 1:9)
- **Affirm:** Scripture's grand narrative (Creation-Fall-Redemption-Consummation) as historical reality. Biblical stories as God's authoritative revelation. (2 Timothy 3:16)
- **Affirm:** Union with Christ through ordinary means of grace. Mystical experiences must align with Scripture. (John 17:21, WCF 27)
- **Affirm:** Humans created in God's image (Genesis 1:27), radically corrupted by the Fall (total depravity). Only grace restores spiritual life. (WCF 4.2, 9.3)
- **Affirm:** The prohibition against making images of the Godhead stems from the Second Commandment, which states, 'You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them' (Exodus 20:4-5 ESV). The Westminster Larger Catechism Q. 109 explains this commandment forbids 'the making any representation of God, of all or of any of the three persons, either inwardly in our mind, or outwardly in any kind of image or likeness of any creature whatsoever.' Since God is infinite, eternal, and unchangeable (WCF 2.1), any attempt to depict Him through created things inevitably diminishes His glory and leads to idolatry.

Here is a list of confessions and catechisms that are affirmed with my theology:
    * The Westminster Confession of Faith (1647) and Catechisms (1647)
    * Westminster Confession of Faith
    * Westminster Shorter Catechism
    * Westminster Larger Catechism
This list of confessions and catechisms may not be accurate in every detail but they are still valued as important expressions of Reformed theology:
    * The Three Forms of Unity (1561, 1619, 1675):
    * Belgic Confession
    * Heidelberg Catechism
    * Canons of Dort
